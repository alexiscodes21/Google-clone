The purpose of this app is to practice cloning a website with React. It is a clone of Google with full search functionality. It is an MVP. Soon, I will add the dark mode under the settings menu on the bottom right corner, and the apps menu under the apps icon in the top right corner. The rest of the links, link to Google's actual pages.
