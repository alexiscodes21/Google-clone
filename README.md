The purpose of this app was to practice cloning a website with React. It is a clone of Google with full search functionality. It is an MVP. Soon, I will add the dark mode under the settings menu on the bottom right corner, and the apps menu under the apps icon in the top right corner. The rest of the links, link to Google's actual pages. When going through the commits, you may see a lot of test commits and merging repos. I origianlly accidentally committed the file with the API key to Github. After some research, I was able to remove those commits by installing git filter-repo, cloning the repo, and merging. Since this was my first time doing this, I made some mistakes and had to redo the process of filtering, cloning, and merging again. It was definitely a learning experience because in the end, I'm glad that I made that mistake because I was able to learn more about cloning and merging.
